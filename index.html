    </p>
    <h2>Projects</h2>
    <hr />
    <p>
        <b>Capstone: Speech to Speech Translation (S2ST)</b> | <i>Python, BERT, PyTorch, LLM</i>       08/2023 - 12/2023
        <ul>
            <li>Developed a cascaded S2ST system for English to Hindi translation, using pre-trained checkpoints of Wav2vec 2.0 (ASR), MBART-50 (MT), and VITS (TTS) from Hugging-Face.</li>
            <li>Enhanced S2ST pipeline robustness using an LLM to identify, then correct the ASR transcript’s syntax and semantics, reducing WER by 50% (ChatGPT) compared to the ASR-only baseline.</li>
            <li>Errors were flagged by contrasting confidence scores of the ASR and LLM for the tokenised transcript, with flagged errors masked and rectified using contextual predictions from the LLM.
            </li>
            <li>Compared the performance of 3 LLMs for this task BERT-small (11.46% WER), BERT-large (6.43% WER), and ChatGPT (0.67% WER) with an ASR-only baseline (1.72% WER).
            </li>
    </p>
    <p>
        </ul>
        <b>Diabetic Retinopathy Detection System </b> | <i> Python, PyTorch, CNN</i> 01/2023 - 05/2023
        <ul>
            <li>Developed a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model using PyTorch and PyTorch Lightning for diabetic retinopathy detection, leveraging the Inception V3 architecture.</li>
            <li>Used an Imbalanced Data Sampler for random oversampling to mitigate data bias.</li>
            <li>Implemented extensive image preprocessing techniques, including rescaling, color normalization, and contrast adjustment, to standardize and enhance image quality.
            </li>
            <li>Conducted rigorous k-fold cross-validation and evaluated model performance using metrics such as ROC curve, AUC, accuracy, and classification report.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Anime Watch-list Database System</b> | <i>PostgreSQL, MongoDB</i> 01/2022 - 05/2022
        <ul>
            <li>Used the Anime Watch-list data-set from Kaggle to gain deep insights into the users such as the top 10 most re-watched anime for female users by region, top unreleased anime by most users planning to watch it.
            </li>
            <li>These queries can be used for targeted advertising for customers.</li>

        </ul>
